Linux for beginners: Process management in Linux
===============================================

Commands you will be familiar with this tutorial:

ps --> It is one of the important utilities for system administration under process monitoring

kill --> kill command in Linux is a built-in command which is used to terminate processes manually. 




Let’s go to how "ps" command is used in day to day monitoring operations

1. List All Processes in Current Shell
	ps

2. Display every active process on a Linux system
	ps -Af or ps -ef

3. Dispaly the processes owned by you
	ps -x 

4. Display every processes running with root user privileges
	ps -U root -u root 

5. Display processes owned by a certain group (real group ID (RGID) or name)
	ps -fG apache
	ps -fG 48

6. Display processes by PID
	ps -fp 1178

7. Display process by PPID
	ps -f --ppid 1154

8. Print process Tree
	ps -e --forest 
	ps -f --forest -C sshd

9. Show custom output format of a specefic PID with pid,ppid,fgroup,ni,lstart,etime
	ps -p 1154 -o pid,ppid,fgroup,ni,lstart,etime


10. Find a process name using its PID.
	ps -p 1154 -o comm=

11. Find top running processes by highest memory and CPU usage
	ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head
	ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head

12. To kill a Linux processes/unresponsive applications or any process that is consuming high CPU time.
	First, find the PID of the unresponsive process or application.
	ps -A | grep -i stress
	kill -9 2583 2584

13. Perform Real-time Process Monitoring Using Watch Utility
	watch -n 1 'ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head'
